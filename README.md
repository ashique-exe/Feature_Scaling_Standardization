# Feature_Scaling_Standardization
     Feature engineering involves
    1. Imputation: Handling missing data using mean, median, mode, or advanced methods.
    2. Scaling/Normalization: Ensuring features are on the same scale using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization.
    3. Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical forms (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
    4. Feature Interaction: Creating new features by combining existing ones (e.g. multiplying or dividing features).
    5. Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA or t-SNE reduce feature space while preserving key information.
    6. Discretization: Binning continuous variables into categories.
            These methods enhance model efficiency and predictive power.
